what's up mans, call me as the windows slayer. i like hack microsoft technologies and to joke windows users.
i am android user, arch linux fan but i like bsd systems too.
i play with c++ (my love), webassembly (just interest), qt/qml (basic) and powershell core (know somethings).
if you wanna talk with me about works, new projects or friendship, i have a instagram account (@romthewindowsslayer)
